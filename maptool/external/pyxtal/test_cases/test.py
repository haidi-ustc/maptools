'''
Test the functionality of ss_strin_from_ops
prints Hermann-Mauguin point group symbol for the site symmetry of each Wyckoff
position in each space group. Can be compared with WYCKPOS on the Bilbao server:
http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cgi-bin/cryst/programs/nph-table?from=getwp
Note that our notation is slightly different: if only one axis is present, Bilbao
sometimes forgoes placing dots in the symbol. We keep these dots to differentiate
between axes.
